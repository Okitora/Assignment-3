            see up to 400 people through our gates, however during a special or 
            invitation meet we see numbers of 4000 plus. Visitors come from all 
            over the North Island, this not only creates revenue for the 
            Speedway but filters out to the wider community; Kaikohe, Kerikeri,
            Kawakawa, Paihia etc. Kaikohe Speedway was put on the world map with 
            the recognition of Florian Habichts movie Kaikohe Demolition.</description>
